This is the third maintenance release of the openvas-manager 7.0 module for the
Open Vulnerability Assessment System release 9 (OpenVAS-9). The OpenVAS Manager
is the central management service between the actual security scanners and the
user clients.

This release fixes various issues, improves the migration routine and
especially addresses performance issues.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release:
Matthew Mundell, Timo Pollmeier, Jan-Oliver Wagner, Michael Wiegand,
Raphael Grewe, Christian Fischer and Juan Jose Nicola.
