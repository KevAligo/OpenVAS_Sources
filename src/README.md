### Installing Source Code

For installation from source code, it is recommended and assumed that you are familiar with the procedure to build and install software from the actual source code.

Both procedures, building from source code release and building from source code repository follow the same common way.

After download enter each main directory and follow the instructions in the “INSTALL” and “README” files.

Typically you will need to install various missing dependencies such as development libraries. The configuration process tries to help you to find out about what is missing.
